# OpenTrons_Immunostaining
Protocol for immunostaining of mammalian cells cultured in 96-well plate

The user must seed the cells in columns. The number of samples/wells, along with
primary and secondary antibody dilutions are taken from the user at the beginning.
The required amounts of reagents are then calculated in the protocol and given to the user.

The temperature module will be used to keep the antibodies at 4C.
